NAME
     bfc â€“ brainfuck compiler

SYNOPSIS
     bfc [-o out_file] [-S] [-c] [-v] [-C bfc1_path] [-a as_path] [-l ld_path]
	 [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     Simple implementation of brainfuck language compiler.

     First argument is input source code file, other arguments is flags for
     compiler.	These are options you can pass to bfc:

     -o out_file
	     Output file path, default is "a.out"

     -S	     Not compile assembly code.

     -c	     Not link object file.

     -v	     Verbose mode, show all running commands.

     -C bfc1_path
	     Path to real compiler.

     -a as_path
